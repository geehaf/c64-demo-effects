Looking into C64 demo effects, here is one I personally never saw that often - 26 rows of text on the C64. The effect makes use of opening the top & bottom borders and $d011 yscroll bits to push the screen down a row, at specific raster line. This effectively forces another line of text by causing an additional “badline”* when the display is normally hidden by the border. With some careful $d018 screen base swapping we end up with 26 rows of text. Link to PRG & source in C64 Studio format below. Should work on PAL/NTSC. 

*The VIC II basically repeats the previous line so to be able to show non-repeating text, the code uses a raster to adjust the screen base in $d018 to alternate between $0400 and $0c00 which means we can have different text for the repeated line, and equates to the row at $0f98
